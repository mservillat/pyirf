Instrument Response Functions
=============================


Effective Area
--------------

The collection area, which is proportional to the gamma-ray efficiency
of detection, is computed as a function of the true energy. The events which
are considered are the ones passing the threshold of the best cutoff plus
the angular cuts.

Energy Dispersion Matrix
------------------------

The migration matrix, ratio of the reconstructed energy over the true energy
as a function of the true energy, is computed with the events passing the
threshold of the best cutoff plus the angular cuts.


Point Spread Function
---------------------

The PSF describes the probability of measuring a gamma ray
of a given true energy and true position at a reconstructed position.
